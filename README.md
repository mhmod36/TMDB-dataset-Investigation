# TMDB Dataset Investigation

Investigate the data set that contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb) from 1960 to 2015,
including user ratings and revenue. Analyze what kind of properties are associated with movies that have high profit.

In this project, I have used Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier.
